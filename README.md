## Demonstration

### Homepage

This is the homepage of my app; currently, it features two quizzes—one on politics and the other on tech entrepreneurship.

The image depicts a mobile application called "Quizzy App," designed to offer quizzes that enhance knowledge. The following elements are visible:

- **Header Illustration**: An illustration at the top displays a person seated at a desk, engaged in writing or studying, surrounded by books and plants.
- **App Title**: Beneath the illustration is a blue banner with the text:
  - **Quizzy App**
  - "Engage with this exciting quiz app to boost your knowledge."
- **Quiz Categories**: Under the banner, a section labeled "All items" presents two quiz categories:
  - **General Knowledge**
    - Sub-category: Tech
    - Duration: 10 min (accompanied by a clock icon)
  - **Politics**
    - Sub-category: World
    - Duration: 10 min (accompanied by a clock icon)

The design is user-friendly and inviting, simplifying the process for users to choose and begin their quizzes.

- **Answer Options**: There are four options listed:
  1. Donald Trump

- **Action Button**: An orange "Next" button is situated below the answer choices.

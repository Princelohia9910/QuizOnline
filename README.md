## Demonstration

### Homepage

This is the homepage of my app; currently, it features two quizzesâ€”one on politics and the other on tech entrepreneurship.

The image depicts a mobile application called "Quizzy App," designed to offer quizzes that enhance knowledge. The following elements are visible:

- **Header Illustration**: An illustration at the top displays a person seated at a desk, engaged in writing or studying, surrounded by books and plants.
- **App Title**: Beneath the illustration is a blue banner with the text:
  - **Quizzy App**
  - "Engage with this exciting quiz app to boost your knowledge."
- **Quiz Categories**: Under the banner, a section labeled "All items" presents two quiz categories:
  - **General Knowledge**
    - Sub-category: Tech
    - Duration: 10 min (accompanied by a clock icon)
  - **Politics**
    - Sub-category: World
    - Duration: 10 min (accompanied by a clock icon)

The design is user-friendly and inviting, simplifying the process for users to choose and begin their quizzes.

### Quiz Interface

The image depicts a mobile application called QuizOnline running on an Android emulator identified as Medium Phone API 35. Here's what's shown:

- **Time Indicators**: The top bar displays the time as 9:26 alongside a shield icon. Below that, the question label reads "Question 1/4" and the current time is shown as 09:51.
- **Quiz Content**: The quiz question is presented within a blue box and asks, "Who is the president of USA."
- **Answer Options**: There are four options listed:
  1. Donald Trump
  2. Narander Modi
  3. Biden
  4. Putin
- **Action Button**: An orange "Next" button is situated below the answer choices.
- **Guidance Message**: At the bottom, a message prompts users to "Please select answer to continue."

This is the results page of the app, which displays the number of answers you have selected correctly.

- **Pop-up Message**: In the center of the screen, a message announces that the user has passed the quiz with a score of 75% (3 out of 4 correct). It includes a congratulatory note, a circular progress indicator showing 75%, and a "Finish" button.
- **Timer**: Displays 09:07.

By clicking on the finish button, you can return to the home screen.
